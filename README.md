<h1>Welcome to my Employees Project!</h1>

Languages used for this project:

1] React

2] Redux for global state management

3] Tailwind & Chakra UI for css styles

I made most of the functionalities that are required; however, there are some adjustments that need to take place in design responsiveness & in form validation! I wish I had more time to work on them & give the company a perfect version of the project on time!

Finally, I don't regret anything because I absolutely gave my best on this project! Regardless of what the result of the interview process will be, it was a great experience & I benefited from every stage of it!
